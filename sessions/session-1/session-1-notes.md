# Pykidz Sessions - Session 1
* Welcome to Pykidz! - A Kideveloper initiative.
  * This, is a series of classes for getting a basic understanding of python, the progamming language.
  * This is your first class and before we get started, let us first understand something fundamental:
* Why should we learn to program? Why should we code?
  * Coding gives us the power to create. It is both an art and a science. Very soon, everybody will need to code. It will become similar to learning mathematics in your school.
  * Learning a language is a first step as a developer. It is a start of a long journey. It is also important to learning the vocabulary of a programmer or developer or techie is very important. And as we move forward you will surely discover the words by which a developer lives.
  * Going forward I will just refer to you as a developer. I like that word because it indicates that you are developing something - creating or building something.
  * There are many other things to learn. We start with Python.
* But why Python?
  * It is a great language for beginners
    * It is english like
    * It has got a simple syntax. Of course you will ask me what syntax is - Syntax of a language is a collection of rules to follow so that language is understood by the computer. It is like grammar of a language - say English. This is a simplification of what exactly is happening but it will suffice for now.
  * Build anything
    * You can do almost anything using python alone. It is called the "Batteries included" nature of python.
    * You can build web applications, games, serious business or enterprise applications. even mobile or IoT apps. You can do data analysis and create visualisations too.

* Install Python on platforms
  * Open the python.org in the video.
  * Go to downloads section. Just straight to installer sections
  * Windows installer
  * macOS installer
  * Linux - comes with python out of the box - means it is built into or bundled with linux.
* The terminal
  * Open the terminal app in the video - Talk about it for 30 secs - Call it the command line at the end.
  * exit it and open it again
* Python versions Show the python version
  * `python --version` - I am using the python command
  * Use the download page and talk about major release and maintenance release
  * There are multiple versions of python and they signify different features. The notes mention the changes, fixes etc. - show them
  * which is a higher version and a later or newer version - `3.8.5 > 3.8.1` - latest version
  * we need version greater than 3.7.
* Python shell
  * Ability to give commands to python
  * Try out different keywords and syntax
  * Try out language features
  * Quickly play with it to figure out how to move forward to solve your problem.
  * `print "Hello world"` - This is most traditional way to start to learn
  * Use arrows to go back and get older commands - show this and talk about it
  * exit it and show. Get back in.
* If you want to take a break, this is a good time.

* Let us get started. Now that we have covered all the python setup related ideas and concepts, let us get into exploring the language. We need to get into the python shell for that.
* Calculations
  * Multiplication, division, subtraction, addition, exponentiation - 200, 255
  * Use simple numbers first. And then show an example of big number for multiplication and division. (Use arrows)
  * Mention of the term of operators - this is arithmetic operators
  * Mr.Tenali - Introduce him.
  * Simple interest - Use this as as example - Mr.Tenali - P = 100000, R = 8 T = 5
  * Another example - Profit percentage - 150 SP - 125 CP
    * Explain order of operations (BO DM AS) Left to right
    * Show how it goes wrong and how you can correct it with parenthesis
* Variables
  * Place to store information
  * Label to a value - refer to data
  * Variables in math
  * Show assignment of data to a variable
    * `number_of_mangoes = 20`
    * `mango_owner = "Tenali"`
    * `print mango_owner`
  * Simple interest formula
    * `principal, rate, t`
    * show assignment and calculation
    * Mix big variable names (e.g. principal) with small names (e.g. t). Say what you prefer at the end.
    * Start a variable with a number and show
    * Do the calculation.
    * make a mistake in the variable name and show the error. Correct it
    * Change the value and redo calculation and show the power of variables
    * You can also see that with names what you are doing is clearer. Earlier you could just see numbers. Now you see a formula because we have good names.
---

* In the end lets us summarize
  * Programming is an essential skill
  * Python is your simple yet powerful friend
  * You can install python in your computer.
  * Python has versions
  * Python shell is a window to talk to python
  * Python can do calculations using operators
  * Python variables make it easy to re use data and also make the data readable
* You can reach out to me if you have any questions through comments. I will respond to them.
